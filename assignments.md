### Instructions and Caveats
- Academic integrity: 
    - It is okay to discuss the assignment with your peers at a conceptual level. It is also okay to post conceptual or high-level questions, logistical questions, and useful references on Piazza. But do not share any code and do not post any of your solution code for discussion. A student's code submission must be entirely their own.
    - Do not go searching for any code posted online by other students or prior editions. We will use advanced program analysis tools to compare your code submissions. These go well beyond basic string or syntactic comparisons to catch plagiarism.
    - If plagiarism is detected in your code or if any other form of academic integrity violation is identified, you will get zero for that component of your score and get downgraded substantially. I will also notify the University authorities for appropriate disciplinary action to be taken, up to and including expulsion from the University.

<!-- - Team composition:
    - You can work on projects in teams of between 1-3 individuals
    - Submit your team decision via a Google Form we provide before PA0's release. One submission suffices per team. 
    - Team decisions cannot be changed.
    - The TAs will then confirm your team memberships and team IDs. 
- There are no late days for the programming assignments. So, plan your work accordingly!  -->
